# Fake News Detector 📰

## 📌 Project Overview
Fake News Detector is a **Machine Learning based project** that classifies news articles as **Real** or **Fake**.  
The system learns patterns from labeled news data and predicts the authenticity of new news articles.

---

## 🎯 Objectives
- To identify fake and real news using machine learning  
- To reduce the spread of false information  
- To build a simple and effective ML model for news classification  

---

## 🧠 Technology Used
- Python  
- Machine Learning  
- Scikit-learn  
- Pandas  
- NumPy  

---

## ⚙️ Working of the System
1. News article is given as input  
2. Data is processed and converted into features  
3. Machine Learning model is trained on dataset  
4. Model predicts whether the news is **Real** or **Fake**
